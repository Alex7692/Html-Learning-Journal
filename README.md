# Html-Learning-Journal
A self-keeping journal of learning Html. Progress will be recorded for every one to two weeks (Could be different during holidays). The journal will be consisted of a short description, the html file, the source code and some personal thoughts.

It is not recommended for anyone to use it as a reference for personal coding usages, but it is suggested for anyone to use it as a reference to your own learning experiences and to see how I, as a total beginner in coding, has been gradually improve my coding skills through time : )
